# Use_Wordpress_API_in_Swift

## What is it ?

In this repository, you fill find a way to use Wordpress API in Swift. 
I made this project to develop an app dedicated to my Wordpress website (named jeuxvideo.app).

Inside the repo, there is a script to create a list of articles. And when you click on an article, the app open a webview of the website in the current article page.

That's it !
